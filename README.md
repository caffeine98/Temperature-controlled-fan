# Temperature-controlled-fan
A temperature controlled fan using an Arduino, created in TinkerCAD. The circuit uses a TMP36 temperature sensor, which is used to determine when a fan is turned on. The fan remains off until the temperature is greater than 20 degrees Celsius, when it will turn a fan on (represented by a motor).

# Component list

- 1	Arduino Uno R3
